# 2018-project-pjg
This Web-Application has been created by Pierre-Jean Berthelon and Guillaume Wallerich, students at Lulea Tekniska Universitet for the lecture Design of Dynamic Web System.
The web-application has been developped during the Fall Semester 2018 - LP2 (6th november --> 18th december)
The aim of the project is to create a web-application where kids can learn to code with predetermined functions. You can see what the function is doing thanks to a robot which will perform the fucntion. For example the function turnRight() will move the robot to the right.

Progression: Just the beginning

Language used: don't know yet but certainly a front-end framework and node.js on the back-end.

This project comes from the lecture Design of Dynamic Web System. We have to create a web app to be graded ^^
